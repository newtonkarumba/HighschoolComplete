# HighschoolComplete
The folllowing were the steps I took to make this project:
 1. Make a Student Class

This class needs an interface to implement the relevant oop principles.
1.a. add student -adds a new student to the students list

1.b. find students -views all the students stored in the students db.

1.c.update student -updates a specific student in the list

1.d.delete student -deletes a specific student in the list


2. make a Teacher Class
This class also needs an interface to implement the relevant oop principles.

2.a. add teacher -adds a new teacher to the teachers list

2.b. find teachers-views all the teachers stored in the teachers list

2.c. update teachers -updates a specific teacher in the list

2.d. delete teachers -deletes a specific teacher in the list


3. Make a Course class
This class also needs an interface to implement the relevant oop principles.

3.a. add results -adds a new result to the results list. 

3.b.update all -views all the results stored in the results list

3.c.delete result -deletes a specific result in the list



Each class needs a relevant interface to allow for more scalability and flexibility.
The project also includes useful tests to run. as well as a DB Connection Interface and class to assist in connecting and modifying the database.
